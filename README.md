## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/9a9d9bfd-df42-45cc-a427-77a6f9a76f70.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@9a9d9bfd-df42-45cc-a427-77a6f9a76f70)

I'm currently working on [CrimsonAIO](https://github.com/CrimsonAIO), an upcoming sneaker/retail/NFT bot currently in closed beta.

I used to do Minecraft stuff; check out one of my projects, [LunarClientSpoofer](https://github.com/LeviDevs/LunarClientSpoofer)

I primarily use Go and SQL. I was working with Java and Kotlin for 4 years before moving into the sneaker scene.
Most of my work nowadays revolves around reverse engineering web applications.
