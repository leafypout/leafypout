  About
</h2>

<p align="center">
I'm a 22 year old self-taught Software and DevOps engineer from New Zealand. I started out by working on Minecraft (Java Edition) servers,
primarily my own server that reached 200 concurrent players and eventually another that reached 500 concurrent players on multiple occasions. My work on  these projects involved creating and maintaining server plugins that were optimized to handle potentially thousands of players, integrated with services  like MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis. I also developed efficient server-side anti-cheat technology that was capable of accurately detecting in-game cheaters. I  also made <a href="https://github.com/levi-nz/LunarClientSpoofer">LunarClientSpoofer</a>, a client-side mod that makes servers think a player is using <a   href="https://www.lunarclient.com">Lunar Client</a>.

I entered the sneaker botting scene in 2021 where I focused my efforts in reverse engineering web security vendors, mainly <a href="https://www.akamai.com/products/bot-manager">Akamai Bot Manager</a>, which still works today and is capable of circumventing their solution at large scale. I am also currently working on a solution to circumvent <a href="https://www.perimeterx.com">PerimeterX</a>, which so far has been successful and has posed no challenges. My work involving reverse engineering these vendors has primarily been JavaScript deobfuscation and generating synthetic telemetry data.

Before becoming an engineer, I used to voulantry moderate Minecraft servers and forums, which lead to me having experience in the moderation field. I am currently the only administrator in the <a href="https://discord.gg/sneakerdev">Sneaker Development</a> Discord server, which as of writing has 12k members. Sneaker Dev is a large community and marketplace, allowing members to seek code help, including reverse engineering related to web security vendors, and buy & sell software and other products & services. Myself and the small team of moderators keeps the server environment safe, including the removal of any members that violate Discord's Terms of Service, or have affiliation with illegal activities (like credential stuffing).
