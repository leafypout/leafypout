  About
</h2>

<p align="center">
I'm a 22 year old self-taught Software Engineer from New Zealand. I started out by working on Minecraft (Java Edition) servers,
primarily my own server that reached 200 concurrent players and eventually another that reached 500 concurrent players on multiple occasions. My work on  these projects involved creating and maintaining server plugins that were optimized to handle potentially thousands of players, integrated with services  like MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis. I also developed efficient server-side anti-cheat technology that was capable of accurately detecting in-game cheaters. I  also made <a href="https://github.com/levi-nz/LunarClientSpoofer">LunarClientSpoofer</a>, a client-side mod that makes servers think a player is using <a   href="https://www.lunarclient.com">Lunar Client</a>.

I entered the sneaker botting scene in 2021 where I focused my efforts in reverse engineering enterprise bot management solutions, mainly <a href="https://www.akamai.com/products/bot-manager">Akamai Bot Manager</a>, which still works today and is capable of circumventing their solution at large scale. I have also reverse engineered <a href="https://www.imperva.com/products/web-application-firewall-waf/">Imperva</a>. I am also currently working on a solution to circumvent <a href="https://www.perimeterx.com">PerimeterX</a>. My work involving reverse engineering these vendors has primarily been JavaScript deobfuscation and generating synthetic telemetry data in Go and Rust.
